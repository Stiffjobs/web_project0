# Project 0

I use a Bootstrap Navbar for indexs html files.
#index.html
This file is the homepage of this introduction to stuffs related to Apple.
and put a Apple icon image and a statement about Apple.
I also use a responsive @media function to change the welcome content and icon image size under the navbar
when hover on the navbar button it will change to color royalblue so do the click for more button.

#index2.html
This is a website briefly introduce Steve Jobs's innovations and designs.
Where I use a table to list those things.
In this page, every font's family is Lucida, which I use sass variable attribute to make it happen.

#index3.html
This is a webpage introduce what kinds of mac are available now to us and the brief history about Macintosh which also known as Mac.
When introducing Mac's brief history, I use a unorder list component from Bootstrap and a table component to demonstrate all kinds of Macintosh. 
In the index3.scss file I use the nesting technique to make sure the lh tag have a large size of font and a li tag have a medium size of font. In addition I use the variable to make the not hover color be black and hover be royalblue.
