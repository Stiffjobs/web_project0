I use a Bootstrap Navbar for indexs html files.

and put a Apple icon image and a statement about Apple.
I also use a responsive @media function to change the welcome content and icon image size under the navbar

#index2.html
This is a website briefly introduce Steve Jobs's innovations and designs.
Where I use a table to list those things.
In this page, every font's family is Lucida, which I use sass variable attribute to make it happen.

#index3.html
This is a webpage introduce what kinds of mac are available now to us and the brief history about Macintosh which also known as Mac.
When introducing Mac's brief history, I use a unorder list component from Bootstrap and a table component to demonstrate all kinds of Macintosh. 
In the index3.scss file I use the nesting technique to let li tag have a medium size of font and a (list-style-type: none) of unorder list. In addition I use the variable to make the not hover color be black and hover be royalblue.
also using a inheritance to set up for a tag to change their color and control the font-size.
