                        The Lisa sold poorly, with only 100,000 units sold.
                        In 1982, after Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project, he joined the Macintosh project. The Macintosh is not a
                        direct descendant of Lisa, although there are obvious similarities between the systems. The final revision, the Lisa
                        2/10, was modified and sold as the Macintosh XL</td>

                        airplane accident and temporarily left the company. Jobs introduced the Macintosh computer on January 24, 1984. This
                        was the first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse. This first
                        model was later renamed to "Macintosh 128k" for uniqueness amongst a populous family of subsequently updated models
                        which are also based on Apple's same proprietary architecture. Since 1998, Apple has largely phased out the Macintosh
                        name in favor of "Mac", though the product family has been nicknamed "Mac" or "the Mac" since the development of the
                        first model. The Macintosh was introduced by a US$1.5 million Ridley Scott television commercial, "1984". It most
                        notably aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984, and some people consider the ad a
                        "watershed event" and a "masterpiece". Regis McKenna called the ad "more successful than the Mac itself".
                        "1984" uses an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by a Picasso-style picture of the
                        computer on her white tank top) as a means of saving humanity from the conformity of IBM's attempts to dominate the
                        computer industry. The ad alludes to George Orwell's novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four, which describes a dystopian future
                        ruled by a televised "Big Brother."
                        
                        The Macintosh, however, was expensive, which hindered its ability to be competitive in a market already dominated by the
                        Commodore 64 for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses.
                        Macintosh systems still found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second-largest PC
                        manufacturer for the next decade.</td>

                        introduced in 1988 at a lavish launch event. Using the NeXT Computer, Tim Berners-Lee created the world's first web
                        browser, WorldWideWeb. The NeXT Computer's operating system, named NeXTSTEP, begat Darwin, which is now the foundation
                        of most of Apple's products such as Macintosh's macOS and iPhone's iOS.
