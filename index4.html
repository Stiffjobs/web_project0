            <td>The birth of the revolutionary technology that would eventually power the iPhone didn’t start with a grand vision for reshaping the way we communicate. It started with a plan to fix the most cumbersome parts of a computer: the mouse.

                In 2003, Apple started internal experimentation to find a way to replace the mouse with a touchpad that offered much more control and flexibility. Their initial design, a tablet-sized, finger-controlled interface known as the Model 035, allowed users to pinch, scroll, and zoom – all things that were currently unavailable on modern computers.
                
                This project was eventually put aside though when it became clear that Apple had more pressing issues…</td>

                The iPod was released in 2001 and quickly became not only a consumer favorite (eventually selling nearly 400 million units) but also one of Apple’s major revenue streams.

But even as iPod sales were climbing rapidly, Apple’s executive team knew its days were limited. Customers were carrying around both an iPod and a mobile phone and were convinced that the mobile phones would eventually have the ability to play music, something that would make iPods obsolete.

To keep the company profitable and maintain its position as a market leader in tech innovation, Apple executives knew they needed to come up with the next generation of mobile phones before their competitors did.

        <tr>
            <td>
                Apple’s first step in this direction was to partner with Motorola for the release of the Rokr E1. It was an iTunes compatible mobile phone that allowed consumers to store songs and play them through an iPod-like interface. Unfortunately, it’s significant limitations meant it was never going to redefine the market. It was only able to hold 100 songs, its clunky interface was difficult to navigate, and its slow upload rate was frustrating to use.
